fix: connectors now follow dragged elements in real-time

Root cause: useRemoteNotes returns all notes (including the current user's)
from Firebase RTDB. The noteMap/shapeMap merge used `updatedAt >=` which
always let remote snapshots overwrite local drag overrides (equal timestamps),
so ConnectorsLayer always read the pre-drag position from the database.

Fixes:
- Skip remote note/shape override when a local drag override exists for that ID
- Guard all four local-override cleanup effects (notes, shapes, text, frames)
  against clearing overrides for the element currently being dragged, using
  a draggingElementIdRef kept in sync via useLayoutEffect
