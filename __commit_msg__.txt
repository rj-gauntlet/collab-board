feat: canvas feature set — frames, text, connectors, undo/redo, zoom, snap, export

- Standalone text elements with inline HTML editor (resizable, transparent bg, border in edit mode)
- Frames with styled title bar, separator line, ellipsis truncation, and inline title editor
- Connectors with anchor-point routing (closest edge midpoints) and inline label editor
- Connector/frame-title editors overlay exactly on the element using board-space coords
- Real-time drag: connectors follow shapes/notes as they are dragged
- Text formatting toolbar (bold, italic, font size, font family, color) for selected text
- Undo/Redo (Ctrl+Z/Y) with 50-step history and full Firestore sync on restore
- Zoom controls UI (+/-, %, fit-to-screen button)
- Fit-to-screen: computes union bbox of all elements and zooms/pans to show them all
- Snap-to-grid: applied on drag-end for notes, shapes, frames, and text elements
- Grid overlay (GridLayer) toggled from header
- Export canvas as PNG via Konva stage.toDataURL (retina quality)
- Pinch-to-zoom (mobile/touch) via visualViewport-aware handlers
- Browser zoom resilience: visualViewport + ResizeObserver + window resize listeners
- Konva Stage pixelRatio tracks window.devicePixelRatio; Stage remounts on DPR change to eliminate blur
- Canvas size uses Math.ceil to prevent 1-px unrendered slivers on zoom
- Jest + Testing Library setup with mocks for Konva and Firebase
